# Automation-Project-for-the-Release-of-Classes-in-a-School-
This project aims to optimize and organize the process of releasing classes at the school where I study. It consists of: an operator has access to a WEB page that allows each class to be released in the order defined by the operator. The WebServer will be hosted by an ESP32 board, which will communicate with 12 other ESP32 boards.
