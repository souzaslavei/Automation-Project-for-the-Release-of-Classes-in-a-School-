#Automation-Project-for-the-Release-of-Classes-in-a-School-
This project aims to optimize and organize the process of releasing classes at the school where I study. It consists of: an operator has access to a WEB page which allows each class to be released in the order defined by the operator. The WebServer will be hosted by an ESP32 board, which will communicate with 12 other ESP32 boards (one in each class). The board that will be inside a class will only have the function of receiving the command from the main board and lighting up an LED that will indicate the release of that class. At first, I am developing the graphical part of the WEB Server, to later integrate it with the ESP32 code (which I will still start to develop).
